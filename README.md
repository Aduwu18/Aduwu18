# Hi there, I'm Xinyu Qian 👋

**Ph.D. Candidate in Civil Engineering @ University of Science and Technology Beijing**

I specialize in **Physics-Informed InSAR** for urban infrastructure health monitoring.
My goal is to make satellite observations **transparent**, **precise**, and **useful**.

| Core Dimension | Key Question I Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🧩 Interpretability** | *What is the physical origin of this scatterer?* |
| **📊 Reliability** | *How confident are we in this measurement?* |
| **🏗️ Applicability** | *How do we integrate structural priors?* |
