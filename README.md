# Hi there, I'm Xinyu Qian 👋

**Ph.D. Candidate in Civil Engineering | University of Science and Technology Beijing**

My research bridges **InSAR remote sensing** and **infrastructure monitoring**, with a core focus on making satellite observations **physically interpretable** and **statistically reliable**.

Instead of treating InSAR merely as a black-box measurement tool, I work on decoding the **scattering physics** of urban infrastructure and quantifying the **uncertainty** of deformation measurements to ensure they meet the rigorous standards of structural engineering.

## 🔭 Research Philosophy

My goal is to advance **Physics-Informed InSAR** by answering three fundamental questions:
1.  **Interpretability:** *What is the physical origin of this scatterer?* (Is it a parapet, a pipe, or a sidewalk?)
2.  **Reliability:** *How confident are we in this measurement?* (Quantifying uncertainty in phase estimation).
3.  **Applicability:** *How do we integrate domain knowledge?* (Using structural priors to refine inversion algorithms).
