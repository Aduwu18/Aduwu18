# Hi there, I'm Xinyu Qian 👋

**Ph.D. Candidate in Civil Engineering @ University of Science and Technology Beijing**

I bridge **InSAR Remote Sensing** and **Infrastructure Monitoring**.
My mission is to transform InSAR from a "black box" into a **physically interpretable** and **statistically reliable** tool for structural engineering.

### 🔭 Research Focus: Physics-Informed InSAR

I tackle three core challenges to make satellite data engineering-ready:

* **🧩 Interpretability:** Decoding the *physical origin* of scatterers (e.g., separating thermal dilation from deformation).
* **📊 Reliability:** Quantifying *uncertainty* in phase estimation to ensure statistical confidence.
* **🏗️ Applicability:** Embedding *structural priors* into inversion algorithms for high-fidelity monitoring.
